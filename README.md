## 📌 What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a computer vision application that interprets human-written numbers (0-9) from images. It's often a beginner-friendly project in deep learning and is used in postal mail sorting, bank cheque verification, and digit-based form processing.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **MNIST Dataset**, which contains:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images
- Image size: 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- Digits: 0–9

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** consisting of:
- Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense layer with Softmax for classification
