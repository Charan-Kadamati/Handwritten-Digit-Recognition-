## üìå What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a computer vision application that interprets human-written numbers (0-9) from images. It's often a beginner-friendly project in deep learning and is used in postal mail sorting, bank cheque verification, and digit-based form processing.

## üìä Dataset

We use the **MNIST Dataset**, which contains:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images
- Image size: 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- Digits: 0‚Äì9

## üß† Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** consisting of:
- Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense layer with Softmax for classification

## üïπÔ∏è Live Demo App (Pygame)

Draw a digit in a GUI window and the model will predict it in real time using OpenCV and Pygame.
